<p>When accessing contents on the internet, the majority of the content creators and websites fail to realize the difficulties people with disabilities have when accessing the internet. 
    Despite the existence of applications for assisting people with visual and audible impairment access content on the internet, there is still a lot of spaces online that don’t follow guidelines like the ones by the Web Accessibility Initiative ( https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), that outlines practices that help make web more inclusive and accessible to all. 
</p>

<p> For example, for people with visual impairments, it can be hard certain tasks like read text or see image properly, or even subscribe certain content due to Captcha and other anti-robot enablers. 
    An adjustment in the coding and technical part of the project can help, like audio description of photos or products. </p>

   <p>Another example is when content is made, it is important to see if there isn’t anything that can trigger physical reactions like seizures. More significant, is to integrate this kind of attitude into digital projects so that we don't leave a portion of potential customers and clients out.
