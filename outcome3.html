 <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? 
        Could you have done it in teams?
        </h2>
<p>When making the website, it would be more effective not only a extended deadline, but also the division of tasks between teams it would turn perhaps the project less daunting and more effective as the tasks could have more easily completed. 
However, working alone presents its own pushes to own productivity and efficiency skills, which makes the benefits greater in terms of future learning. 
    </p>

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    </h2>

<p>To improve productivity in digital projects, it is not only important to follow own work rhythms, and find the best methods to enhance productivity. 
For example, one of the most used in the Pomodoro technique (https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), which not only allows to give a concentrated timeframe to perform certain tasks ( between 20 to 25 minutes) to do our work, but also enables the existence of breaks, very important to maintain some balance and avoid overworking, specially for those who work all day in front of a screen, giving time for having some water, or stretching. 
</p>
<p>As for efficiency, the priority should be given to the use of a proper organization method, specially when given tasks. After that, there are other techniques that can be used, specially when working alone or in groups. 
For example, delegate tasks instead of concentrating when working as a team can improve efficiency, specially when coupled with project management methods such as kanban. But, when working alone, specially in hard tasks, it can be overwhelming, so a good work plan to follow, with tasks planned to make the most of the work, such as the Pareto Principle - 80% of results that come from 20% of action, which helps determine the task with most urgency and most results.

<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
</h2>
 <p>To improve my efficiency, i would first tap into my own life experiences and adjust the use of the IT. 
     I would continue to use Trello, to keep me updated into my tasks and helped me develop a long term commitment to the project in hands. As for group project, it wasn't at all necessary, but would have been helpful just to share the difficulties of the project with other colleagues. 
     Regarding the communication solutions, I do find them a distraction when working, specially because personally I enjoy having my own silence/music without the feeling of having to tap into other people from time to time.

<h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</h2>

<p>As for testing digital solutions, such as a website, it is important not only to make sure that the site runs without errors in its nature, with correct links on its pages, but also make sure it works in different devices, specially nowadays where a lot of devices are being used to acess content on the internet, such as mobile phones or tablets. </p>
<p>The testing of digital solutions also needs to have in account the scale of the project, if it's a small business enterprise that have never had a online presence or a big corporation that is looking to update its channels, the customers are different, so the solutions also need to be different between them, adjusting to their target market and customers, and their functions too.
