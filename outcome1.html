<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

<p>These days, a business without an IT component on their site can run the risk of becoming themselves obsolete. 
    Whether it is a customer relationship management system, or a website, or an e-commerce shop, the purpose of IT in modern business serves to drive innovation, efficiency and growth within a business context.  
    
    Also, the IT in a business setting can reduce costs in communication, in information processing and other areas of a business where the previous organizational structure does fail to provide an appropriate response to current business setting. 
    For example, in these current days, where the pandemic forced a lot of businesses to adapt into new circumstances, the adherence to IT systems and solutions like e-commerce shops or deliver apps.

<h2>1.2  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>

<p>To make a digital project successful, we need to consider no only the nature of the project but also the resources and abilities at our reach
    Not only we need to consider the traditional concept of project management, but also the way “digital” is conceptualized, and how these two realities collide and combine when delivering a project.
    As for methods, the rise of digital project made the appearance of several methods possible to follow, like Agile, Kanban, Scrum, Waterfall, amongst others - they are all part of methodology – a system of practices, techniques, procedures and rules used within a discipline (https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/project-management-methodologies-made-simple/ ). 
    The methods and methodology used are very important and should be used and/or adapted according to the size of the project. Regarding the methods used, they all should be easy to follow and access and must be adaptable to the size of the project.
</p>

<p>Regarding skills, not only is necessary a good understanding of technical skills but also soft skills, like an effective communication style, that includes not only the capability of listening other opinions and other members of the team but also being able to communicate and listen to clients, in order to communicate in a clear and concise style, but that also appeals to other people.
</p>
<p>As for tools, there a myriad of software solutions, either paid or free, that can be used to adapt. This tools can be used for either communication purposes, like Slack, for time and project management – like Trello – or for storage information, like Dropbox or Google Suit.  
</p>

<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? 
Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>

<p>As planning for my website, I will use the formula as suggested by the website xbs software,  (https://xbsoftware.com/blog/website-development-process-full-guide/) which gave a good breakdown of the steps necessary for building a website. 
    Adapting to the rhythm of the course and the content taught, we come up with the following steps:

    -   	Phase 1 – Prepare
     This phase will include the information gathering and planning of the project of the website, considering the brief given.

    -   	Phase 2 – Design
    The design phase will include not only the design of the project but also the content production, namely the writing of the content said.

    -   	Phase 3 – Site Development
    This phase will include the coding of the website said, integrating the content into the website. It will collaborate closely with the Phase 4.

    -   	Phase 4- Testing
    This phase encompasses the testing of the website, to see if the elements fit right in and consider the feedback given. Phase 3 and 4 will be directly connected as the more “practical part” of the project.  
    
    -   	Phase – 5 – Launch
    This is final phase, where the final project has been finalized and ready to be launched after all the changes have been made.
    As indicated, the trello board link is here: https://trello.com/b/N0oufvjH/own-website-coursework1, with the breakdown of the tasks as described above.

<h2> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
</h2>

 <p> When projecting a digital project, the risk of failure can be quite high, specially when taking into account reasons like a undefined and unclear initial strategy and vision – like for example, a client comes over and brings an idea for a website, but does not know his brand statement, colours, target), or when final project does not fit the expectations/needs of the client, because the conceptualisation of the project did not take into account the product/service and the final costumer – the public to whom the product/service is destined to. 
     Also, the communication and cooperation within a team may not be effective and unclear towards the members of team or the client.
</p>

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
    </h2>

<p>When it comes to select and use IT systems and software for the job itself, I would first access the nature of the project and the resources available. However, how it would be applied would also consider the need of the client and the final product, if it is easily accessed and maintained in the future. 
Also, its important, to ponder the size of the company, or the project, and the budget available, and use them as parameters to find the best technology for the job.
Lastly, being also able to talk and communicate with co-workers and collaborators to access the existent IT infrastructure, and to see if someone is already proficient in some technology or needs more training, or the solution found needs to come from within the company/project or can come from outside. 
</p>

<h2>.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
    achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can Git and GitHub help with your code’s version control
    </h2>

<p>The chosen technologies- Trello and GitHub – they served different purposes thought out the project.
    Regarding methodology, Trello was the main technology behind the Kanban method applied to the project. Being know by simplicity to read and use, and easy access. Trello is a good beginner´s technology to use because it provides a good introduction to project management.  
    Trello helps to better visualize goals and plan tasks, offering the chance to star conceptualizing better digital projects and flow better through them, not leaving any step by chance.
    As for GitHub, being a code sharing and publishing service, its purpose as system is meant to store drafts of technical projects. By allowing a better control of the changes made into the code after revision, it is very useful when not only working alone so it is a safe way to store all versions to better modify and identify errors, which are very important as a beginner, but also when collaborating with team because the sharing allows a further networking, which enables a more kindred learning trajectory because we not only learn from others but also we get the chance to teach something ourselves thus consolidating our knowledge.

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    </h2>
<p> The GDPR – the EU protection data law- impacts a lot of projects not only within European context, but also worldwide.
    By protecting the personal data of citizens online, GDRP has put a lot of constraints in digital projects, specially of those customer-centric areas such as sales and marketing. For example, is no longer legal to hold costumer’s data without their direct consent and sharing it with other entities. 
    However, the GDRP should be seem more that a constrains and more of legal guideline to be followed. When the law was enforced, a lot of companies panicked facing the possibility of a further digital transformation and changing of IT systems. 
    However, this kind of guidelines can be helpful in digital projects design and management because it can give a more direct approach to how projects can be planned and new solutions can come across, more effective and innovative. 
    Also, can be a influx of new projects just made to adjust and comply to European standards, specially from digital products/services from outside EU/EEA area.
