<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
    your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h2>

<p> The use of the IT tools proves to be challenging in the beginning, specially Visual Studio Code, as it has come up with a lot of mal functions even during the learning process, which made everything a bit harder to apprehend. 
    However, in the end it became a little more easier to manage and understand. 
</p>
<p>On the other end, the other IT solutions used for project management and communication, such as Zoom, Slack and Trello were easy to master and used. 
    Trello, as the main software used for project management, made it easy and quick not only to update the status of the tasks, but also to visually have a understanding of the project, enhancing the perception of the tasks needed to complete the website.
</p>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
</h2>

<p>The IT tools mainly used, Visual Studio Code and Trello, they were appropriate in away that were the first tools learned, so the early contact made it easy to master them and complete the assignment given, despite the difficulties with the visual studio code, mentioned in the answer in the last question
</p>
<p>As for Trello, as enjoyable it was for coming up with tasks and complete them in flow, however it is hard to always keep up with and updating. 
    Despite the separation of the tasks and steps, if some of the tasks overlap, it makes harder to follow through, making someone, even if its working alone, to repeat some tasks, specially when some tasks depend on others to be completed, or they are happening at the same time. 
</p>

<h2> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
 <p>As for a beginner, the outcome of the website is good up to a certain point. The challenge of coming up with such a website in a short space of time and knowledge makes it ok, but overall I would say I am satisfied with the website. 
     I would definitely change a lot of things, however due to short timeline, the most important contents are present. 
</p>

<h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project
</h2>
<p> I would definitely improve the content layout, specially the way is presented and worded, for SEO purposes and following the best practices for web writing. 
    I would also include more visual content as opposed to written, since most content online this days is either visual or video based, and would also think of a more consistent design, perhaps a more consistent branding.  
</p>

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
</h2>

<p>The outcomes of this project are a bit behind the requirements of the project, as it lacks a bit more of work in it, specially around the visual content and respecting the websites features amongst the structure planned. 
    However, do they fit the purpose of the brief given, which is to deliver the content asked for.
